Here we want to give the category 0 to 9 to some pictures that represents handwritten digits.

The dataset is the famous MNIST handwritten digit, as from scikit-learn.

This is my work based on the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems" by  Aurélien Géron.

# Evolution of the model:
The model evolved in 3 steps:
* First Stochastic Gradient Descent model (accuracy 93.4%)
* Then choosing a better model: KNN Classifier (avcuracy 96%)
* The fine tuning the model (accuracy of 97.1%)
